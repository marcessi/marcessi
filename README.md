# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Marc

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC), specializing in Computer Science.

### ðŸ’» About Me

- ðŸŽ® Passionate about software development, computer graphics, and video games
- ðŸ”§ Interested in low-level systems, real-time rendering, and game engines
- ðŸŒ± Currently improving my skills in C++, Python, and parallel computing
- ðŸ“š Always curious about how things work under the hood

### ðŸš€ Featured Projects

#### [Whomp'Em Remake](https://github.com/marcessi/WhompEm)
A modern recreation of the NES classic *Whomp'Em* using C++ and OpenGL. It features:
- Rich player animations and combat mechanics
- Power-ups, enemy AI, and boss fights
- Multiple UI screens, sound effects, and music
- Fully animated HUD and Ice Totem weapon system

#### [miniJ](https://github.com/marcessi/miniJ)
An interpreter for a subset of the J programming language, built as an academic project. It includes:
- Array manipulation and basic operations
- Variable assignments and definitions
- Arithmetic, relational, and special operators
- Function definitions and composition using ANTLR and Python (NumPy)
- Example syntax: `x =: 1 2 3`, `+/ 1 2 3 4 = 10`, `mean_square =: (+/ % #) @: *:`

Feel free to check it out and see how a minimal J interpreter works under the hood!
