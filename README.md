### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### [Cerebro comercial](https://github.com/marcessi/Cerebro-Comercial)  
A complete software solution for product distribution optimization, developed for the PROP (Programming Projects) course using a three-tier architecture:  
- Full product catalog management with CRUD operations  
- Advanced distribution algorithms, including:  
  - Brute-force baseline  
  - 2-Approximation  
  - Hill climbing  
  - Iterated local search  
- Real-time modification and evaluation of product placements  
- Data input via manual entry or import/export files  
- Focused on optimizing product similarity and customer purchase probabilities in a circular rack layout  
- Built in Java with Gradle, supports GUI and automated testing  

#### [Whomp'Em Remake](https://github.com/marcessi/WhompEm)  
A modern recreation of the NES classic *Whomp'Em* using C++ and OpenGL. It features:  
- Rich player animations and combat mechanics  
- Power-ups, enemy AI, and boss fights  
- Multiple UI screens, sound effects, and music  
- Fully animated HUD and Ice Totem weapon system  

#### [📱 iPhone Calculator](https://github.com/marcessi/iphone-calculator)  
An exact replica of the iPhone calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Features authentic iOS design and complete functionality:  
- **Authentic UI**: Official colors, San Francisco font, and hover effects that match the real iPhone calculator  
- **Complete functionality**: All basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷), percentage, sign change, decimal handling  
- **Smart features**: Error handling, scientific notation for long numbers, 9-digit display limit  
- **iPhone behavior**: Persistent display, intuitive input flow, and proper state management  
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining the authentic look  
- Built with pure vanilla JavaScript - no dependencies required  

#### [miniJ](https://github.com/marcessi/miniJ)  
An interpreter for a subset of the J programming language, built as an academic project. It includes:  
- Array manipulation and basic operations  
- Variable assignments and definitions  
- Arithmetic, relational, and special operators  
- Function definitions and composition using ANTLR and Python (NumPy)  
- Example syntax: `x =: 1 2 3`, `+/ 1 2 3 4 = 10`, `mean_square =: (+/ % #) @: *:`  

Feel free to check it out and see how a minimal J interpreter works under the hood!
